## TrybeWarts
First project done in pairs! [Sergio Cassete](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergiocassette/) and I developed this project together at the end of block 6, in which _HTML forms, frameworks(bootstrap), and flexbox_ were studied.

![how the trybewarts project works](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99998543/161824448-9b5570dd-687b-4c56-bfac-21e2f184047b.gif)

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. When entering the email `tryber@teste.com` and the password `123456` in the _inputs_ of the _header_, an alert will appear saying **'Hello, Tryber!'**;
2. There is a _character_ counter in the text area, in which, as characters as are written, it counts and updates how many **spaces are available** before reaching the maximum limit;
3. The _send_ button can only be activated after the "agree" field is __selected__;
4. After clicking on the _submit_ button, the form is replaced by the **answers** of the user.

In addition, the page was made using several resources of _Forms_ in HTML, and its styling was done using knowledge in **flexbox** and **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)**.
